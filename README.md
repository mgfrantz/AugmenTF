# AugmenTF

> A library inspired by [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) to implement utilities and tools in TensorFlow 2.


Currently, there's great support for images, thus I'm tackilng text first.

TODO:
* [ ] Dataloaders for text data
  * [ ] CSV loader
  * [ ] Textfile loader
  * [ ] Exporting as TFRecords
* [ ] Preprocessing: tokenization and text preprocessing
  * [ ] dealing with punctuation, repetition, beginning / end of sentences
  * [ ] wordpiece?
* [ ] Vocabulary / embeddings augmentation for transfer learning
* [ ] One-cycle policy
* [ ] [LR-Finder](https://www.avanwyk.com/finding-a-learning-rate-in-tensorflow-2/)
* [ ] Discriminative learning rates and layer groups
* [ ] Saving history, plotting losses and metrics
